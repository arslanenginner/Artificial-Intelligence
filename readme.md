# AI Pipelines and Models
This repository contains:

* AI pipelines created in Python during my learning journey.
* Code for using Hugging Face models with built-in pipelines.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on two datasets.
Feel free to explore the code, learn from the pipelines, and dive into the EDA process for the datasets!
